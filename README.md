> Heyyy! I just built this cool little piano using only **vanilla JavaScript**  yep, no fancy frameworks here!

You can play notes, record your own melodies, and save them so you can jam anytime you want. It’s super simple but sooo much fun!

## What You Can Do

- 🎵 Click piano keys (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si) and hear real sounds  
- 🎶 Start typing your melody by clicking notes  your song shows up live  
- 💾 Save your masterpiece with a title  and it gets saved to the backend  
- ❌ Double-click a saved melody to delete it (if you want to tidy up)  
- ✨ All smooth and easy to use, with a clean vibe

## How It Works (the cool stuff)

- When you open it, it fetches all the piano sounds from the backend  
- You click "Start Typing" to begin your melody  every note you press adds to the track  
- Hit "Save," type a title, and your melody gets saved to the server  magic!  
- You can see all your saved melodies and delete them if you’re feeling picky

## Wanna Try It?

1. You’ll need a backend running on `http://localhost:3000` that has `/notes` and `/melodies` endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE).  
2. Open the page and start making music!  
3. Share it with friends, or just vibe alone  your call.

## Why I Made This
